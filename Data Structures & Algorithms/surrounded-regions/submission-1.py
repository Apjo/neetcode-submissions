    Only the 'O' regions that touch the border can never be surrounded, because they have a path to the outside of the board.
So instead of trying to find surrounded regions directly, we do the opposite:
    -mark all border-connected O cells as "safe" to "T"
    -any remaining O cells is truly surrounded so flip to X
    -convert any remaining T cells to O
